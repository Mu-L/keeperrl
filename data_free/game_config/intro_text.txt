"Welcome to KeeperRL v1.1! This patch was released on Oct 22nd, 2024.

The latest update introduces a new faction called the \"Corrupted Church\". Below is a very short summary, and we encourage you to check out the full change log at keeperrl.com.

* Build and finish a church to conduct masses for you congregation.
* Write liturgy books for special mass intentions, such as protection, faster digging or summoning help.
* Research unholy ideas in order to perform a Black Mass and use the power of The Evil God Adoxie to punish your foes.

If this is your first time playing KeeperRL, remember to start with the tutorial!
